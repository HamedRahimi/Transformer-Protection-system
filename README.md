We designed a smart security system that sets up on a transformer to detect stealing by motion detection and voltage existence via IR Sensor and Voltage Detector. then it sends the danger alarm to the security control room via SMS by GSMSIM900 
This system is equipped with a PID controller that makes temperature stay at the fixed degree to prevent high-temperature disturbances by reading the temperature from the DHT11 sensor and delivering that to the PID controller. Then the controllerâ€™s output controls the speed of the fan  that makes temperature stay at a fixed degree
