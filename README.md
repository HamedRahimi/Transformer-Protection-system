#Transformer Protection System
We have designed a smart security system that sets up on a transformer to detect stealing by motion detection, IR Sensor, and Voltage Detector. then it sends the danger alarm to the security control room via SMS by GSMSIM900 module.
This system is equipped with a PID controller that makes temperature stay at the fixed degree to prevent high-temperature disturbances by reading the temperature from the DHT11 sensor and delivering that to the PID controller. Then the controllerâ€™s output controls the speed of the fan  that makes temperature stay at a fixed degree.    
o Implemented for Electricity Distribution Company (EDC) of Shiraz city.
o Developed with voltage Sensor, IR Sensor, GSM SIM900 module, and Arduino Micro.
o Designed to send the stealing Alert by SMS and Warning Alarm.
